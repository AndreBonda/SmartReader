<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Horror stories about the increasingly unpopular taxi service Uber have
                                been commonplace in recent months, but there is still much to be learned
                                from its handling of the recent hostage drama in downtown Sydney, Australia.
                                We’re told that we reveal our true character in moments of crisis, and
                                apparently that’s as true for companies as it is for individuals.</p><p>A number of experts have challenged the idea that the horrific explosion
                            of violence in a Sydney café was “terrorism,” since the attacker was mentally
                            unbalanced and acted alone. But, terror or not, the ordeal was certainly
                            terrifying. Amid the chaos and uncertainty, the city believed itself to
                            be under a coordinated and deadly attack.</p><p>Uber had an interesting, if predictable, response to the panic and mayhem:
                            It raised prices. A lot.</p><p>In case you missed the story, the facts are these: Someone named Man Haron
                            Monis, who was considered mentally unstable and had been investigated for
                            murdering his ex-wife, seized hostages in a café that was located in Sydney’s
                            Central Business District or “CBD.” In the process he put up an Islamic
                            flag – “igniting,” as <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/15/us-australia-security-idUSKBN0JS0WX20141215">Reuters</a> reported,
                            “fears of a jihadist attack in the heart of the country’s biggest city.”</p><p>In the midst of the fear, Uber stepped in and tweeted this announcement:&nbsp;
                            <span>“We are all concerned with events in CBD. Fares have increased to encourage
                                more drivers to come online &amp; pick up passengers in the area.”</span>
                        </p><p>As <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/12/14/uber-sydney-surge-pricing/">Mashable </a>reports,
                            the company announced that it would charge a minimum of $100 Australian
                            to take passengers from the area immediately surrounding the ongoing crisis,
                            and prices increased by as much as four times the standard amount. A firestorm
                            of criticism quickly erupted – “<a href="https://twitter.com/Uber_Sydney">@Uber_Sydney</a> stop
                            being assholes,” one Twitter response began – and Uber soon found itself
                            offering free rides out of the troubled area instead.</p><p>That opener suggests that Uber, as part of a community under siege, is
                            preparing to respond in a civic manner.<em></em>
