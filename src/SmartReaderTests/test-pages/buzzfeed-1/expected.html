                                        <p>Eloise Parry, 21, was taken to Royal Shrewsbury hospital on 12 April after taking a lethal dose of highly toxic “slimming tablets”. </p>
                                        <p>“The drug was in her system, there was no anti-dote, two tablets was a lethal dose – and she had taken eight,” her mother, Fiona, <a href="https://www.westmercia.police.uk/article/9501/A-tribute-to-Eloise-Aimee-Parry-written-by-her-mother-Fiona-Parry">said in a statement</a> yesterday.</p>
                                        <p>“As Eloise deteriorated, the staff in A&amp;E did all they could to stabilise her. As the drug kicked in and started to make her metabolism soar, they attempted to cool her down, but they were fighting an uphill battle.</p>
                                        <p>“She was literally burning up from within.”</p>
                                        <p>She added: “They never stood a chance of saving her. She burned and crashed.”</p>
